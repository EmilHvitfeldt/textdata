## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* fully specified URL (https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/AffectIntensity.htm) in lexicon_nrc_eil.R. (The url correctly ends in .htm not html.)

> Is there some reference about the method you can add in the Description field in the form Authors (year) <doi:.....>?

There is no reference to the way the package operates. The datasets  should all have appropiate references in documentation and download prompts. 

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.0
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

## Downstream dependencies

I ran R CMD check on the 2 downstream dependencies and there were no problems related to textdata.
